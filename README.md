# Resume
My resume built using [jsonresume](https://github.com/jsonresume/). Most themes don't work very well and the schema isn't enforced (and for a good reason). Will probably switch to a full fledged resume site in the future.

## Usage
`./make.sh` to build the web and pdf version of the resume.
